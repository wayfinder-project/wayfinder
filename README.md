# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is an innovative trip planning app, aiming to make it easy for
users to plan and take a trip from start to finish. Wayfinder allows users to
plan routes with multiple waypoints, search for lodging and attractions at
each waypoint and keep a checklist of trip essentials. Wayfinder allows users
full access to all the trips they have created in the app, where they can
track their progress and update details as they go.

## Objectives

- Provide an intuitive and attractive user interface for planning a trip from
  start to finish
- Allow users to update and monitor trip status on-the-go by tracking their
  position alongside the route
- Assist users in managing trip essentials through a checklist
- Integrate with Airbnb and Google's Places API to display lodging locations
  and points of interest near each waypoint

## Current state

Wayfinder is currently under heavy preliminary development.

## Key concepts and definitions

To keep the project uniform and understandable to users, Wayfinder uses a set
of consistent vocabulary to describe its central concepts and components. The
following list is intended to be a comprehensive reference for developers and
users alike.

- **route**: the path that the user takes from their starting point to their
  destination
- **waypoint**: a single stop along a route. The starting point and
  destination are considered waypoints as well.
- **leg**: a portion of the route between two adjacent waypoints
